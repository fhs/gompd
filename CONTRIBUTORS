# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the GoMPD repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>
#
# An entry with two email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the second address should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with Rietveld.

# Please keep the list sorted.
